# This test was written to test that the payload feature creates .in and
# .out files to disk when we expect them.  Generally, if the payload
# feature is off or payloads are routed to cribl, then we don't expect
# payloads to be written to disk.  The only exception: if
# payloads are routed to cribl and APPVIEW_PAYLOAD_TO_DISK=true,
# then we expect payloads to be written to disk.
#
# At this time, we're not testing the *contents* of the payload files,
# or the names of the files, just the existance of them.

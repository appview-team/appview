    - title: Instrument
      icon: tachometer-alt
      shortDescription: Use the simple command line to easily instrument and inspect any application or Linux command, regardless of runtime, including Go binaries. There’s no need for any code modification, or a man in the middle proxy. It’s like strace meets tcpdump, but with readily consumable output. You can even attach to already-running applications.

    - title: Observe
      icon: microappview
      shortDescription: Send application information, wire and log data, and performance metrics to existing log analytics and metrics tooling. For quick results, visualize with our terminal dashboard. AppView collects StatsD-style metrics about applications and structured, wide events events for file access, DNS, and network activity. AppView even looks inside encrypted payloads for service mesh-like visibility into applications without proxying traffic.

      shortDescription: Secure your applications by providing allow and deny lists for network and file resources.
